"""Schema migrations.

Applies every .sql file in postgres/migrations, in filename order, exactly once,
recording what has run in the schema_migrations table. bot.py runs this before it
starts, and it can also be run by hand against any database with:

    uv run -m utils.migrate

To change the schema, add a new numbered file to postgres/migrations. Never edit a
file that has already been applied -- the runner only tracks filenames, so the edit
would silently never reach production.
