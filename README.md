---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The official Discord bot for Northwestern Esports.

Also affectionately referred to as Miku.
</pre>
</div>

## About

Provides utilities for the Northwestern Esports Discord server, such as:

- Schedule and games list for Northwestern's game room
- Lobby creation tools for games like VALORANT
- Points for chatting that can be wagered and spent on various things

Built with Python and Postgres. Runs on Docker and Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

### Setting up Discord

Create a new app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

There's a couple of additional things you need to do here to configure the bot:

- Installation: Make sure the scopes `application.commands` and `bot` are selected for guild install.
- Bot: Create a bot user, and copy the token.
- Bot: Make sure all privileged gateway intents are enabled.
- Emojis: If you want to utilize any custom emojis for features like special users or ping reacts, you'll need to upload them here.

### Setting up Config

The bot uses the files `config.yaml` and `secrets.yaml` to store configuration.

After cloning the repository, copy the `config.yaml.example` and `secrets.yaml.example` files to `config.yaml` and `secrets.yaml`, respectively.

> [!CAUTION]
> The `config.yaml` and `secrets.yaml` files should stay gitignored. Pushing them to the repository can leak sensitive info such as discord ids, tokens, and passwords.

Values that need to be input are marked with comments. The only ones that are strictly required to run the bot are:

- `secrets.yaml -> discord.token`: The bot token you copied from the Discord Developer Portal.
- `secrets.yaml -> guild_id`: The guild id of the server you want to install the bot in. If you're not sure how to get this, follow [this guide](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028717192-Where-can-I-find-my-Application-Team-Server-ID).

### Running via Docker Compose (Recommended)

Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

From the root directory of the repository, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Running Locally

Running the bot locally requires a few additional steps.

Make sure you have [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

From here, make and activate a virtual environment with your favorite tool ([venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda), etc.).

Then, install the required packages with:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
```

Additionally, you will also need a Postgres database to connect to. There are multiple ways to set this up:

- Install and run [locally](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- Use [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
- Use a cloud provider of your choice ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql), [Railway](https://docs.railway.com/guides/postgresql), etc.)

After you have Postgres up and running, modify `secrets.yaml` (and/or `compose.yaml`) to point to it -- the defaults are set up for Docker Compose.

## Database

The schema lives in `postgres/migrations` as numbered `.sql` files. The bot applies any it
hasn't seen yet on startup, tracking them in a `schema_migrations` table, so a deploy brings
the database up to date on its own. Existing data is never dropped or recreated.

### Changing the schema

Add a new numbered file and deploy:

```sql
-- postgres/migrations/003_whatever.sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS nickname TEXT;
```

Two rules:

- **Never edit a migration that has already run.** The runner only tracks filenames, so an edit
  to an applied file silently never reaches production. Add a new file instead.
- **Write migrations to be additive.** Prefer `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` over anything that drops
  or rewrites data. A migration that fails aborts startup rather than let the bot run against a
  half-applied schema, so a bad one means downtime until it's fixed.

To apply them by hand instead of via a deploy:

```bash
uv run -m utils.migrate
```
